## Contributions
We propose a novel methodology for performing a threat analysis on e-voting systems. Our research includes the following contributions:
- A mapping of the [properties and principles](https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectId=0900001680726f6f) identified by the Council of Europe  to verifiable voting system properties from academic literature.

  - A description of the properties that a secure e-voting system should satisfy is available [here](/A1.pdf).

- The adaptation of STRIDE methodology and LINDDUN framework to the e-voting scenario.

  - A detailed Description of STRIDE and LINDDUN for E-Voting is available [here](/A2.pdf).

- The identification of the most relevant attackers for an e-voting system, with particular focus on the attacker that we call coercer.

  - The list of attackers is available in the summary table of the Threat analysis [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14N2AhBPlWgespNwZJkzUSdZA93pQzpzWIjwAxWeqERo).

- The tailoring of the likelihood factors of the [OWASP Risk Rating method-
ology](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology) to the e-voting scenario, together with new impact factors based on a new methodology to compute the risk.

  - E-Voting adaptation of the Likelihood scale from the OWASP Risk Methodology available [here](/A3.pdf).
