By joining ECTEG as an Academic member in 2023, the Center for Cybersecurity of FBK affirms its commitment to the fight against cybercrime, contributing with technical expertise on cyber safety, and proposing the development of a course on blockchain technology. 

Given the anonymity-by-design approach supported by advanced cryptographic primitives, this kind of technology is widely used by cybercriminals (a primary example being a ransomware attack, asking for payment in cryptocurrencies, which are quite difficult to trace). To contrast these illegal activities, it is therefore paramount to have both a theoretical and practical understanding of the technicalities. 

This is precisely the goal of the training activities that the Center for Cybersecurity aims to develop in collaboration with ECTEG. These activities will incorporate key insights from experts from EU Member Statesâ€™ Law Enforcement Agencies, the educational materials' end-users. 

The Department of Mathematics of the University of Trento (ECTEG member since 2022) also participates in the project through the joint [Laboratory of Applied Cryptography and Blockchain Technology](https://aleph.fbk.eu/collaborations/UniTNAppliedCryptographyBlockchain).
