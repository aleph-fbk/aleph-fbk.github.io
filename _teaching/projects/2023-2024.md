          title: Cryptographic Revocation
          description: >
            There is a strong interest in privacy-enhancing technologies to satisfy the complex requirements of digital identity, in particular minimizing the personal data shared at each presentation, and preventing others from correlating the activity of digital identity credential holders between presentations. Important use cases are the Mobile Drivers’ License (ISO 18013-5) and the European Digital Identity Wallet.
            Cryptographic accumulators, e.g., [BdM93, N05, LLX07, BBF18, VB20] are efficient protocols to prove set (non-)membership that have been proposed as privacy-enhancing credential revocation mechanisms for digital credentials, e.g., [CL02].
            During the internship, you will have an opportunity to consider theoretical and practical aspects of these technologies, to be agreed based on your interest and prior knowledge. We are particularly interested in a performance comparison of algorithms of interest, possibly using existing libraries (e.g., accumulator-rs).

          objectives: The following objectives may be weighted differently according to interest, availability, and the chosen topic
            - Summary of chosen technologies
            - Comparison of technologies on metrics of interest for the chosen scenario, e.g., complexity (number of operations), proof size, offline functionality
            - Exploration of alternatives for cryptographic agility, e.g., other elliptic curves or hash functions
          prerequisites: An undergraduate course in cryptography is required for basic notions. Knowledge of the following would be highly advantageous
            - RSA
            - Elliptic Curve Cryptography
            - Zero-Knowledge Proofs
            - Programming in Python or Rust
          topics:
            - Digital Identity
            - Cryptography
            - Privacy Enhancing Technologies
          timeFrame: Available immediately
