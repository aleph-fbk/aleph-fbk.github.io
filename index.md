# Who we are
In line with the mission of [Fondazione Bruno Kessler](https://www.fbk.eu) (FBK), which aims to achieve scientific research of excellence and have an impact on society, the Applied Cryptography Research Unit of the [Cybersecurity center](https://www.fbk.eu/it/cybersecurity/) of FBK develops cutting-edge security solutions in the following areas: 

- Access Control (e.g., attribute-based encryption, cryptographic access control)
- Privacy-Enhancing Cryptography (e.g., attribute-based encryption, secure multi-party computation, zero-knowledge proofs)
- Decentralization of Trust (e.g., distributed ledger technology, secure multi-party computation, threshold cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs)
- Post-Quantum Cryptography
