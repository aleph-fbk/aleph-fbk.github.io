  title: "Cryptography Bill of Materials: Inventory, Analysis and Risk Assessment of Cryptographic Components in Software"
  type: B
  abstract: >
     This thesis explores the role of Cryptography Bills of Materials (CBOMs) as a foundation for systematic cryptographic risk management, compliance verification, and preparation for the post-quantum cryptography (PQC) transition. A CBOM is a structured, machine-readable inventory that enumerates the algorithms, keys, certificates, and protocols used in a software system, providing the visibility needed to detect deprecated components and ensure alignment with regulatory guidelines. The research began with a survey of CBOM standards and related tools, identifying the software CBOMkit, originally developed by IBM, as the most complete open-source solution for cryptographic inventories. Building on this foundation, the thesis introduces a policy-driven evaluation engine, implemented in Java, capable of assessing CBOMs against customizable compliance policies expressed in a TOML format. The engine defines compliance and assessment levels to classify individual assets and aggregate them into an overall system posture. The extended framework is validated through experiments on a test CBOM and on the CBOM generated from Keycloak, a widely used open-source identity and access management platform. The results show that the system reliably identifies deprecated and disallowed primitives such as SHA-1, 3DES, and AES in ECB mode, and communicates these findings through compliance reports. These contributions demonstrate that CBOM inventories, coupled with automated evaluation, are important for compliance, security, and PQC migration. In particular, they highlight a key principle: organizations cannot effectively replace cryptography for the quantum era unless they first know precisely what is already in use.

  title: "Combining cryptography, risk assessment and usability for secure e-voting systems"
  type: P
  abstract: >
     Remote electronic voting is a multi-faceted subject that cannot be fully addressed from a single perspective. The design of a secure and effective e-voting system requires a careful balance of mathematical rigor, robust information security measures, and usability considerations. In this thesis, I explore these interconnected dimensions to propose a comprehensive solution, which was called Vote App, that ensures both security and usability. In addition, this thesis introduces the Amun voting protocol, an improved voting protocol derived from the one developed during my master's thesis.

  title: "Studio dei pattern di revoca nelle liste di revoca dei certificati digitali"
  type: B
  abstract: >
    L’integrità di Internet si basa in gran parte sulla fiducia garantita dai certificati X.509. Tuttavia, quando questi certificati sono compromessi o non sono più affidabili devono essere revocati. La ge- stione della revoca dei certificati è da tempo una componente di fondamentale importanza dell’attuale infrastruttura Web PKI. Molti metodi di revoca ampiamente riconosciuti e frequentemente utilizzati per i certificati X.509 presentano però delle limitazioni. Tali carenze comportano sfide rilevanti per garantire l’affidabilità e la trasparenza dell’infrastruttura di revoca. Questa tesi fornisce un’analisi dei meccanismi di revoca dei certificati più comuni, ponendo parti- colare attenzione sul metodo Certificate Revocation List (CRL). Lo studio inizia con un’analisi dello stato dell’arte nel campo della revoca dei certificati, partendo dai certificati X.509 fino ad arrivare ai principali meccanismi di revoca presenti, esaminandone le vulnerabilità e le limitazioni, ma evidenziando al contempo la loro rilevanza. Successivamente viene fornita una panoramica sulle motivazioni della revoca dei certificati, sull’importanza di un intervento tempestivo e sui diversi metodi disponibili per attuare la revoca. Segue poi un esame dettagliato del meccanismo CRL. Per analizzare il comportamento delle CRL e le loro prestazioni è stato sviluppato uno script personalizzato che utilizza e modifica alcune delle funzioni fornite dal repository tls-gen [25] di GitHub per generare certificati e CRL. Sono stati con- dotti una serie di test emettendo, e successivamente revocando, un sottoinsieme di certificati in ordine casuale e misurando varie metriche delle prestazioni, quali il tempo necessario per generare e leggere le CRL, nonché il tempo impiegato per verificarne la validità e cercare i certificati al loro interno. Sono state inoltre calcolate statistiche chiave, tra cui media, mediana e deviazione standard dei tempi di ricerca per certificati revocati e non revocati, per diverse dimensioni di CRL. Nella seconda parte della tesi è stata condotta un’analisi empirica dei dati relativi alla revoca dei certificati nel contesto reale. L’obiettivo è stato quello di esplorare e comprendere vari aspetti della revoca dei certificati, tra cui sono presenti i motivi specifici delle revoche, le date di emissione, di re- voca e di scadenza dei certificati, evidenziando le possibili correlazioni che possono essere presenti tra questi parametri. Questa indagine ha fornito importanti indicazioni sui fattori che portano alla revoca dei certificati, cosı̀ come sulle tempistiche che caratterizzano il loro intero ciclo di vita. Studiando questi dati è stato possibile ottenere una visione più chiara delle dinamiche e delle pratiche coinvolte nella gestione delle CRL, contribuendo cosı̀ ad una comprensione più completa delle procedure e delle sfide associate alla revoca dei certificati. Questo approfondimento è fondamentale per migliorare le pratiche correnti e per garantire una gestione più efficace e sicura delle infrastrutture a chiave pubblica. In termini di prestazioni e comportamento delle CRL, le visualizzazioni e i grafici derivati dai da- ti raccolti illustrano come i tempi medi varino all’aumentare delle dimensioni delle CRL, offrendo spunti preziosi sia per la comprensione teorica che per l’implementazione pratica dei meccanismi di revoca dei certificati. In aggiunta, l’analisi dei dati reali provenienti dal Web consente di ottenere una visione approfondita della validità dei certificati revocati e delle variazioni nella loro durata in relazione ai codici di motivo di revoca ad essi associati.

  title: "End-to-End Protection for Data Sharing Among Organizations in Cloud-Managed Blockchain Applications"
  type: B
  abstract: >
    With the development and widespread adoption of the Cloud, data sharing among individuals and organizations has become more convenient than ever before. However, one of the main obstacles that hinders the adoption of Cloud concerns data security and, in particular, data confidentiality and integrity, such as the risk of unauthorized access by third parties, data breaches due to vulnerabilities in the Cloud Service Provider (CSP)’s infrastructure, lack of control over data location, internal attackers and malicious users. Additionally, CSP are often considered “honest but curious”, meaning they might have the motivation or the technical ability to analyze and access to the data they store or process. The arrival of blockchain technology brought a new secure and decentralized approach ideal to guarantee the confidentiality and the integrity of sensitive data, especially in cross-organizational scenarios where multiple equally (dis)trusting parties need to collaborate and exchange data securely. Nonetheless, the blockchain is a difficulty technology to set-up, maintain, and use. For this reason, the adoption of blockchain technology in a serverless fashion is sometimes preferred, in which the duty to manage the blockchain is delegated to a partially-trusted third party, e.g. usually a CSP. The fact that organizations use Cloud-managed blockchains poses again a risk to the confidentiality of data, as the CSP — which handles the nodes composing the blockchain — has ideally access to the data contained within the transactions. In this thesis, we propose a solution for guaranteeing the confidentiality of sensitive data shared over a Cloud-managed blockchain network managed by a partially trusted CSP in cross-organizational scenarios. The solution ensures the confidentiality of the shared data by combining Cryptographic Access Control (CAC) — for end-to-end protection of the data according to Access Control (AC) policies internal to organizations — with Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE) — for achieving effective and secure revocation of access privileges. This project follows a deep analysis of a previous solution proposed by Enrico Marconi [11], which introduces a multi-admin data management system designed to ensure the confidentiality of sensistive data shared on a blockchain network managed by an honestbut-curious CSP. We identify its limitations, such as problems with collusions and the lack of a revocation mechanism, and outline the requirements that our solution must address. Finally, we implements a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the feasibility of the solution.

  title: "A Risk Assessment Methodology for VSNF Placement in Cloud Native Applications"
  type: B
  abstract: >
    In the 2010s, companies started migrating data and services from their private infrastructures to the cloud to gain more flexibility, security and global access. More recently, the evolution of cloud computing resulted in a growing diffusion of cloud native applications, i.e., software applications designed to run within cloud-based environments with benefits like flexibility, scalability, resilience and manageability. An aspect that is sometimes overlooked is that developers are not necessarily security experts and they may not know what Virtual Security Network Functions (VSNFs) are necessary to protect their cloud native application. Then also the placement inside the graph of the application of these VSNFs could be a critical task leaving space to threats and vulnerabilities, and could focus too much on performance. An automation of this process could improve security in cloud native applications. This thesis proposes a novel risk-based methodology to place VSNFs in cloud native applications. First of all, the methodology expects developers to define what assets need to be protected in their cloud native application. Then, the methodology identifies what VSNFs are required to protect these assets and where to place such VSNFs inside the graph of the cloud native application. Afterwards, the methodology proceeds in reducing the number of VSNFs to optimize the consumption of computational resources through the elimination of redundancies. To showcase the benefits of our methodology, we also provide a prototype implementation in Python language1 and a manual usage of it on an example cloud native application. The use of the methodology in the example shows how we arrived to a result that represents a graph ready to be deployed in a real application through a Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) algorithm. This results also in enhancing overall security in the final deployment of the cloud native application.

  title: "Refreshable and Extensible Verifiable Decentralized Secret Sharing for Threshold Access Trees"
  type: M
  abstract: >
    This thesis investigates decentralized threshold secret sharing protocols in cryptography, with a particular emphasis on improving key recovery mechanisms. The research is partially tied to an internship project at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, titled Key Recovery. Safeguarding private keys is a critical challenge, especially for the general public, as losing these keys can result in the permanent loss of valuable assets. Traditional methods, which involve entrusting keys to third-party custodians, present significant risks and may not be suitable for some use-cases, whereas secret sharing schemes allow trust to be distributed among multiple parties, without relying on third parties. Decentralized systems are increasingly being seen as an attractive alternative to centralized ones, due to their benefits in data management, such as avoiding single points of failure or securely storing crypto-assets. For these systems to be a viable alternative, secure decentralized cryptographic schemes are essential. In this context, secret sharing is used in wallet key management to improve the security and accessibility of private keys by splitting them into multiple shares, distributed among different participants or providers. No single participant holds the complete key, and access to the wallet requires a minimum number of shares to reconstruct it. An example of this application is illustrated in [7], where a decentralized wallet model is described from an engineering standpoint. This method reduces the risk of key loss or theft, as the key is never fully exposed in one location. It also enables decentralized management, distributing trust across multiple entities to ensure that even if some shares are compromised, the key remains secure. The starting point is a recently proposed cryptographic key recovery scheme, iii detailed in [6] that leverages distributed secret sharing based on the Shamir’s technique. In particular, the protocol is a totally decentralized version of [5], where a subset of participants plays the role of dealer. Moreover, it allows for the addition of new parties after the initial secret sharing and the possibility of having offline participants. Strategies for making a secret sharing protocol extensible are present in the state of the art, but they often require the presence of a dealer and are therefore centralized. The protocol also includes the verifiability property, meaning that the added participant can verify the correctness of the received share, thanks to the use of commitment schemes. Original Contributions In our work, we analyze the introduction of a refresh phase to the protocol, ensuring proactive security, i.e. the maintenance of security thresholds over time. Proactive security is based on the consideration that if the information stored by participants to share a secret remains unchanged throughout the system’s lifetime, an adversary could eventually breach enough participants to recover the secret, as explained in [8]. To counteract this risk, proactive security introduces the concept of dividing time into periods known as epochs. At the start of each epoch, the shares held by participants are updated, although the shared secret itself remains constant. This approach enhances protection for long-lived secrets, forcing the adversary to start its attack afresh with each new period. We consider a snapshot, mobile and adaptive adversary. A snapshot adversary captures and analyzes a single point in time or a specific snapshot of the system’s state; an adaptive adversary can adapt their strategy based on the information gathered during the protocol’s execution, and in particular a mobile adversary can move among players over time but can only control a limited subset of players at any given moment. The first method for refreshing the shares involves generating and adding a polynomial with a zero constant term to the Shamir polynomial, while the second method involves regenerating the Shamir polynomial while keeping the constant term fixed. These two strategies are shown to be equivalent and proactive-secure against the snapshot, mobile and adaptive adversary model. The third method involves periodically updating the matrix that encodes the secret. This can be underiv stood by observing the parallelism between MDS codes and secret sharing. This strategy, together with proactive security against the snapshot, mobile and adaptive adversary model, achieves also forward secrecy against an adversary that steals a sufficient number of old shares. However, unlike the first two methods, it is shown to be insecure against a continuous-shot, nonmobile, adaptive adversary, where continuous-shot means that the adversary can control the corrupt players continuously in time. Finally, we extend the protocol to integrate more complex access structures among parties, such as groups of participants being more powerful than others and collaborative relationships between them. Access structures define the specific sets of participants who are authorized to reconstruct a secret. Any monotone access structure can be realized by a linear secret sharing scheme, as shown in [12]. Moreover, the most efficient structure, encompassing all others, is the threshold access tree: participants are represented as leaves in a tree, and each internal node has a threshold that specifies the minimum number of child nodes that must be satisfied to activate that node. For this reason, we focus on extending the Secret Sharing protocol to threshold access trees, exploiting also the theory of monotone span programs, as explained in [11].

  title: "Hybrid Enforcement for Role-based Cryptographic Access Control"
  type: B
  abstract: >
    Numerous companies are currently migrating (or have already migrated) their technological infrastructure along with their data and their customers' data to the cloud for, e.g., enhanced scalability, greater flexibility, and monetary cost savings. However, it is well-known that outsourcing the storage of (possibly sensitive) data to the cloud poses significant challenges to the confidentiality and integrity of the data themselves. Indeed, cloud-hosted data are exposed to a wide array of threats including external attackers, malicious insiders, and honest-but-curious cloud service providers (CSPs). In this context, cryptographic access control (CAC) — which consists in enforcing access control (AC) policies through cryptography — is the natural solution to regulate data sharing among authorized users (e.g., employees) while securing data and preventing unauthorized access. Nonetheless, the use of CAC entails the execution of several cryptographic computations (e.g., encryption and decryption computations), especially when considering dynamic AC policies requiring frequent distribution and revocation of users' privileges. Consequently, CAC is typically computationally demanding and may even result to be impractical in some real-world scenarios. In this thesis, we propose an extended role-based access control (RBAC) scheme to mitigate the computational overhead of CAC. Our extended RBAC scheme allows for expressing high-level RBAC policies which are automatically compiled into two sub-policies enforced in a hybrid fashion by a (computationally-light) centralized traditional RBAC enforcement mechanism and a (computationally-demanding) CAC scheme. The automatic compilation is controlled by a customizable security model defining the levels of trust assumed on, e.g., users and CSPs, an approach which allows to determine whether the execution of certain cryptographic computations is necessary or superfluous on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, we apply our extended RBAC scheme to a concrete CAC scheme and provide a proof-of-concept implementation in the Prolog language. Finally, we provide a practical application of our proof-of-concept implementation on a concrete scenario and analyze the cryptographic computational costs incurred.

  title: "A Security Service for Performance-Aware End-to-End Protection of Sensitive Data in Cloud Native Applications"
  type: P
  abstract: >
    The characteristics of cloud native applications — like decentralized architectures, high automation, and dynamic and interconnected microservices — bring forth a number of security challenges across both architectural design and lifecycle management. Some prominent challenges are authentication and authorization, real-time detection of security incidents, network security, microservice (as well as container) security, and, especially, data security. An ecosystem of security mechanisms already exists and provides excellent solutions addressing these challenges throughout the developing and operating of cloud native applications: identity and access management, monitoring and logging, intrusion prevention and detection systems, vulnerabilities assessment and hardening, and cryptography, to mention a few. Nonetheless, despite the availability of such a rich ecosystem, some cloud native applications entail additional considerations linked to the aforementioned challenges — and, in particular, to data security — which may need to be contemplated when evaluating the adoption of security mechanisms and their effectiveness. First, the level of trust assigned to participating parties within the scope of some cloud native applications is inherently limited — e.g., those aligning with the well-known security-by-design and zero trust principles. These cloud native applications confront a multifaceted threat landscape that extends beyond external attackers by including malicious insiders and honest-but-curious cloud providers which threaten the confidentiality and integrity of the (often sensitive) data managed by cloud native applications. Moreover, cloud native applications are frequently deployed in resource-constrained environments — e.g., the Internet of Things (IoT) — or operate in delicate fields (e.g., eHealth, automotive) offering critical functions (e.g., remote monitoring, cooperative vehicle maneuvering) where the quality of service may suffer from computationally or network heavy security mechanisms. In other words, security is not absolute, and its achievement must instead be balanced with that of performance requirements relevant to the underlying cloud native applications — e.g., low latency, minimal bandwidth utilization, and high scalability — underscoring the necessity for nuanced security mechanisms that are mindful of performance aspects. Therefore, in this thesis, we propose a security service addressing the convoluted dynamics of data security in cloud native applications. Our security service comprises four security mechanisms — namely CryptoAC, ACE and ACME, and MOMO — which implement the actual contributions of this thesis as we describe below. First, the threat model of cloud native applications requires preventing unauthorized access to data while offering strong guarantees of data confidentiality and integrity. To this end, we consider the use of cryptography to enforce Access Control (AC) policies — a combination usually called Cryptographic Access Control (CAC) — and propose the design of two CAC schemes, compatible with the aforementioned characteristics, for the end-to-end (E2E) protection of data both in transit and at rest in cloud native applications. We implement both CAC schemes — one for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and one Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) — into CryptoAC , discuss its security, and conduct a thorough performance evaluation. Then, we propose a methodology for evaluating the performance of generic AC enforcement mechanisms — hence, applicable to both CAC and centralized AC — starting from realistic workloads expressed as Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) workflows. In detail, our methodology comprises a procedure deriving sequences of AC requests (e.g., access data, distribute permission) which are representative of the scenarios in which a cloud native application is deployed, and an evaluator executing these sequences against the AC enforcement mechanisms under test; we implement the procedure and the evaluator into ACE and ACME, respectively. Finally, we define an architectural model that identifies the common base building blocks of CAC over which we formalize a Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization Problem (MOCOP) to balance the achievement of security and performance in cloud native applications. Consequently, we implement an algorithm to solve the aforementioned MOCOP in MOMO, for which we provide both a conceptual application and a proof-of-concept application.

  title: "Leveraging Trusted Execution Environment for Efficient Revocation and Security in Cryptographic Access Control"
  type: B
  abstract: >
    The Cloud has become an increasingly popular solution for data sharing and storage due to its inher- ent convenience, scalability, and cost-effectiveness qualities. However, outsourcing (possibly sensitive) data to Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) raises concerns about data privacy and security, as it leaves the data exposed to a heterogeneous set of threats such as external attackers, malicious insiders, miscon- figurations of Cloud services and honest but curious CSPs. To address these concerns, cryptography is usually employed to make the data unreadable by external attackers, while Access Control (AC) policies are defined and enforced to ensure that the data can be accessed by authorized users only. In this context, Cryptographic Access Control (CAC) is the natural solution to enable secure and controlled sharing of (encrypted) data. Essentially, CAC enforces AC policies through cryptography by (i) using cryptographic keys to encrypt data and then (ii) distributing these keys to authorized users. By doing so, CAC ensures that Cloud-hosted data remains protected — i.e., confidentiality and integrity of data are guaranteed — even in the presence of malicious insiders and partially trusted CSPs. In other words, CAC allows organizations to leverage the benefits of the Cloud for data sharing and storage while maintaining a high level of data security and privacy. Nonetheless, aside from its many benefits, CAC comes with its own challenges, especially for what concerns its practicality. In particular, achieving a reasonable efficiency while preserving security during user revocation — that is, the process of revoking the privileges or permissions granted to a user over some data — is a critical challenge in CAC. Indeed, traditional approaches for implementing user revocation in CAC consist in renewing and redistributing cryptographic material (e.g., new keys used to encrypt data) and re-encrypting existing data with the new keys to prevent revoked users from still accessing (i.e., decrypting) the data using cached old keys. Intuitively, the user revocation process incurs noticeable computational costs that hinder the scalability and responsiveness of CAC even to the point of ques- tioning its usability in real-world scenarios. Therefore, in this thesis, we investigate the use of popular hardware-based security technologies — such as Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), Secure Elements (SEs) and Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) — as a solution to address the (currently almost prohibitive) computational overhead associated with tradi- tional user revocation in generic CAC schemes. In particular, we explore the functional characteristics and the security features of these hardware technologies to find the one most suitable for CAC, analyz- ing advantages and disadvantages of client-side and server-side use. Then, we design a methodology that employs client-side TEEs as a mean to mitigate the computational burden of traditional user revocation in CAC. Our intuition consists in exploiting the secure and isolated execution environment of TEEs to perform the cryptographic operations expected by CAC schemes (e.g., en/decrypt data) at the client-side while concealing cryptographic keys from users — who, consequently, cannot cache such keys. In this way, we remove the need for renewing keys and re-encrypting data after a user revocation, significantly reducing the associated computational overhead. We define in detail the flow of operations in our methodology, which encompasses 4 phases, namely onboarding, data upload, data download, and user revocation. In the onboarding phase — executed only once when configuring user' accounts — users are registered in the CAC scheme, while in the data upload and download phases users en/decrypt data according to the CAC scheme being used; in other words, besides for being run within TEEs, our methodology poses no (or minimal) modifications to the logic of the CAC scheme. Lastly, during user revocation, we just need to remove the revoked user's permissions from the AC policy, as the TEE automatically disposes of the keys from the revoked user's device.
