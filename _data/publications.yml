  abstract: >
    To facilitate the adoption of cloud by organizations, Cryptographic Access Control (CAC) is the obvious solution to control data sharing among users while preventing partially trusted Cloud Service Providers (CSP) to access sensitive data. Indeed, several CAC schemes have been proposed in the literature. Despite their differences, available solutions are based on a common set of entities—e.g., a data storage service or a proxy mediating the access of users to encrypted data—that operate in different (security) domains—e.g., on-premise or the CSP. However, the majority of the CAC schemes assumes a fixed assignment of entities to domains; this has security and usability implications that are not made explicit and can make inappropriate the use of a CAC scheme in certain scenarios with specific requirements. For instance, assuming that the proxy runs at the premises of the organization avoids the vendor lock-in effect but may substantially mine scalability. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work considers how to select the best possible architecture (i.e., the assignment of entities to domains) to deploy a CAC scheme for the requirements of a given scenario. In this paper, we propose a methodology to assist administrators to explore different architectures of CAC schemes for a given scenario. We do this by identifying the possible architectures underlying the CAC schemes available in the literature and formalize them in simple set theory. This allows us to reduce the problem of selecting the most suitable architecture satisfying a heterogeneous set of requirements arising from the considered scenario to a Multi-Objective Optimization Problem (MOOP) for which state-of-the-art solvers can be invoked. Finally, we show how the capability of solving the MOOP can be used to build a prototype tool assisting administrators to preliminary perform a ``What-if'' analysis to explore the trade-offs among the various architectures and then use available standards and tools (such as TOSCA and Cloudify) for automated deployment in multiple CSPs.

  abstract: >
    While organisations move their infrastructure to the cloud, honest but curious Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) threaten the confidentiality of cloud-hosted data. In this context, many researchers proposed Cryptographic Access Control (CAC) schemes to support data sharing among users while preventing CSPs from accessing sensitive data. However, the majority of these schemes focuses on high-level features only and cannot adapt to the multiple requirements arising in different scenarios. Moreover, (almost) no CAC scheme implementation is available for enforcement of authorisation policies in the cloud, and performance evaluation is often over- looked. To fill this gap, we propose the toolchain COERCIVE, short for CryptOgraphy killEd (the honest but) cuRious Cloud servIce proVidEr, which is composed of two tools: TradeOffBoard and CryptoAC. TradeOff- Board assists organisations in identifying the optimal CAC architecture for their scenario. CryptoAC enforces authorisation policies in the cloud by deploying the architecture selected with TradeOffBoard. In this paper, we describe the implementation of CryptoAC and conduct a thorough performance evaluation to demonstrate its scalability and efficiency with synthetic benchmarks.

  abstract: >
    It is crucial to ensure the security and privacy of communications in IoT scenarios that process an increasingly large amount of sensitive data. In this context, we propose a cryptographic enforcement mechanism of access control policies to guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of messages exchanged with the MQTT protocol in presence of external attackers, malicious insiders and "honest-but-curious" service providers. A preliminary performance evaluation with a prototype implementation in an open-source tool shows the overhead is acceptable in relevant use case scenarios and provides a higher level of security with respect to other approaches.

  abstract: >
    Pseudorandomness is a crucial property that the designers of cryptographic primitives aim to achieve. It is also a key requirement in the calls for proposals of new primitives, as in the case of block ciphers. Therefore, the assessment of the property is an important issue to deal with. Currently, an interesting research line is the understanding of how powerful machine learning methods are in distinguishing pseudorandom objects from truly random objects. Moving along such a research line, in this paper a deep learning-based pseudorandom distinguisher is developed and trained for two well-known lightweight ciphers, Speck and Simon. Specifically, the distinguisher exploits a convolutional Siamese network for distinguishing the outputs of these ciphers from random sequences. Experiments with different instances of Speck and Simon show that the proposed distinguisher highly able to distinguish between the two types of sequences, with an average accuracy of 99.5%  for Speck and 99.6% for Simon. Hence, the proposed method could significantly impact the security of these cryptographic primitives and of the applications in which they are used.

We follow a systematic approach by identifying relevant OAuth 2.0 specifications and best practices. Having defined our framework, we identify threats applicable to our proposed methodology and detail how our design mitigates them to provide a safer i-voting process.

  abstract: >
    While the security analysis of Access Control (AC) policies has received a lot of attention, the same cannot be said for their enforcement. As systems become more distributed (e.g., centralized services may become a bottleneck) and legal compliance constraints stricter (e.g., the problem of honest but curious Cloud providers in the light of privacy regulations), the fine-tuning of AC enforcement mechanisms is likely to become more and more important. This is especially true in scenarios where the quality of service may suffer from computationally heavy security mechanisms and low latency is a prominent requirement. As a first step towards a principled approach to fine-tune AC enforcement, this paper introduces a methodology providing the means to measure the performance of AC enforcement mechanisms through the simulation of realistic deployment scenarios. To do so, we base our methodology on Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) workflows—that provide for an appropriate abstraction of the sequence of requests toward AC enforcement mechanisms performed by applications—to derive lists of AC operations (e.g., access a resource, revoke a permission) and execute them to evaluate and compare the performance of different mechanisms. Finally, we implement our methodology and apply it to three case studies representative of both traditional centralized AC—i.e., the Open Policy Agent (OPA) and the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML)—and decentralized Cryptographic Access Control (CAC)—i.e., CryptoAC—.

    Verifiable credentials are a digital analogue of physical credentials. Their authenticity and integrity are protected by means of cryptographic techniques, and they can be presented to verifiers to prove claims about the holder of the credential itself. One way to preserve privacy during presentation consists in selectively disclosing the attributes in a credential. In this paper we present the most widespread cryptographic mechanisms used to enable selective disclosure of attributes, describing their structure and comparing them in terms of performance, size of the associated verifiable presentations, and the ability to produce predicate proofs and unlinkable presentations.

    Electronic voting holds the potential to increase voter participation and streamline election processes, but its broad use is limited by many challenges, e.g., ensuring system security and usability. One of the most difficult threats to counter is coercion; i.e., the ability to monitor and force voters' actions. This paper proposes a methodology to assess an e-voting system's resistance to coercion by gathering the security properties that an e-voting solution should offer from both academia and regulation, and adapting the Microsoft STRIDE and LINDDUN threats and the OWASP Risk Rating Technologies to the e-voting scenario.

    The characteristics of cloud native applications — like the inherent decentralization, the intricate threat model, and the presence of highly dynamic and interconnected microservices — bring forth a number of challenges to the security of the (often sensitive) data exchanged in cloud native applications. Besides, data security is not absolute, and its achievement must be mindful of relevant performance and usability aspects (e.g., minimal overhead, transparency, automation, interoperability with external services). In this work-in-progress paper, we discuss the use of Cryptographic Access Control (CAC) in sidecar proxies as a means to guarantee End-to-End (E2E) protection — in terms of confidentiality and integrity — for communications in cloud native applications, as well as usability and adaptable performance.

Typical security mechanisms — such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) or centralized data authorization management — may expose messages to intermediate nodes and fail to enforce Access Control (AC) policies without relying on (sometimes missing) fully trusted agents. Furthermore, when security mechanisms are in place, they should consider the trust assumptions (e.g., on the presence of certain attackers) and meet the performance goals (e.g., low latency, high scalability) relevant to the underlying scenario. In this paper, we propose a security mechanism based Cryptographic Access Control (CAC) that integrates decentralized AC enforcement with end-to-end protection (in terms of data confidentiality and integrity) for IoT applications employing publish-subscribe protocols. By building on previous work, we also formalize an optimization problem to strike the best possible balance between security and quality of service by fine-tuning the deployment of our security mechanism accordingly. We showcase the benefits of the optimization problem in three different scenarios for IoT applications: Remote Patient Monitoring, Cooperative Maneuvering, and Smart Lock. Finally, our open-source proof-of-concept named CryptoAC demonstrates the feasibility of our security mechanism: a thorough performance evaluation reveals that CryptoAC achieves higher scalability than TLS under multi-publisher workloads and a practical level of overhead for key management and policy updates.

    The possibility (and convenience) of storing and sharing data through the cloud entails a set of concerns to data security, such as the presence of external attackers, malicious insiders, and honest-but-curious cloud providers. Cryptographic Access Control (CAC) addresses these concerns but presents practical limitations, primarily due to the computational overhead of key management. In particular, user revocation (that is, revoking a user's access to encrypted data) often requires rotating those Data Encryption Keys (DEKs) to which the revoked user lost access — lest the revoked user might have cached them for future use. Moreover, new DEKs must be distributed to remaining authorized users and data re-encrypted. In this work-in-progress paper, we explore how Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) may conceal cryptographic keys from users in CAC and improve efficiency in key management during user revocation.

    CHide is one of the most prominent e-voting protocols, which, while combining security and efficiency, suffers from having very long encrypted credentials. In this paper, starting from CHide, we propose a new protocol, based on multiparty Class Group Encryption (CGE) instead of discrete logarithm cryptography over known order groups, achieving a computational complexity of O(nr), for n votes and r voters, and using a single MixNet. The homomorphic properties of CGE allow for more compact credentials while maintaining the same level of security at the cost of a small slowdown in efficiency.

    Cryptographic Access Control (CAC) allows organizations to control cloud-hosted data sharing among users while preventing external attackers, malicious insiders, and honest-but-curious cloud providers from accessing the data. However, CAC entails an overhead often impractical for real-world scenarios due to the many cryptographic computations involved. Hence, we put forth a hybrid Access Control (AC) scheme — combining CAC and (traditional) centralized AC — that considers trust assumptions (e.g., on users) and data protection requirements of the underlying scenario on a case-by-case basis to reduce the number of cryptographic computations to execute in CAC. Besides, we design a consistency check to ensure the correctness and safety properties of the enforcement of the hybrid AC scheme, provide a proof-of-concept implementation in Prolog, and conduct a preliminary experimental evaluation.
