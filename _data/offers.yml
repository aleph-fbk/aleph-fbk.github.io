          title: Trusted Execution Environments for Advanced Data Protection
          thesisID: IonAndyDitu_BA
          description: >
            Cryptographic Access Control (CAC) is often employed to protect the confidentiality of Cloud-hosted sensitive data from curious service providers while enforcing access control policies. Unfortunately, CAC usually incurs significant computational overhead that limits its applicability in real-world scenarios [1]. The main goal of this project is to investigate how Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX [2] can synergize with CAC to relieve these computational overheads and efficiently guarantee advanced data protection.

        title: Enhancing Cryptographic Access Control with Predicates and Negative Permissions
        thesisID: SimoneBrunello_BA
        description: >
          Cryptographic Access Control (CAC) is often employed to protect the confidentiality of Cloud-hosted sensitive data from both external attackers and curious service providers while enforcing access control policies. In CAC, the sensitive data is encrypted, and the permission to access the encrypted data is embodied by the (secret) decrypting key. Unfortunately, CAC usually incurs significant computational overhead — mainly due to cryptographic computations — that limits its applicability in real-world scenarios. Moreover, by itself, CAC does not provide suitable abstractions for specifying additional information and constraints (e.g., on how much a user is trusted) that may instead be useful to relieve such a computational overhead. Put in the context of an already ongoing collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh, the main goal of this project is to enhance CAC by investigating one or more of the following ideas: 
          <ol>
            <li><b>Logic Predicates</b>: express assumptions and requirements about users and resources;</li>
            <li><b>Negative Permissions</b>: deny accesses explicitly through a careful distribution of cryptographic keys;</li>
            <li><b>Improved Performance</b>: investigate other means (e.g., use of symmetric vs. asymmetric cryptography) to directly relieve the computational overhead of CAC.</li>
          </ol>

        title: Multi-Objective Microservice Orchestration        
        thesisID: MarcoSoldera_BA
        description: >
          Microservices are the basic building blocks for modern Cloud-native applications. However, the orchestration — and especially the placement — of microservices should be aware of the functional and security requirements of the underlying applications. The main goal of this project revolves around the design of a methodology and a toolset for orchestrating (microservices in) Cloud-native applications to balance the minimization of risks due to the possible presence of security threats (e.g., malicious insider attackers, curious tenants) and the achievement of service performance requirements (e.g., expressed on computational resources, network throughput and latency).

        title: Cryptographic Access Control for Blockchain-based Applications       
        thesisID: LucaClaus_BA
        description: >
          Given the limited trust and inherently centralized nature of Cloud-based applications, the blockchain emerges as the ideal solution to guarantee the integrity and the confidentiality of sensitive data in cross-organizational scenarios. However, the basic security properties offered by the blockchain should be coupled with fine-grained access control policies (e.g., role- and attribute-based access control) enforced through cryptography (e.g., hybrid cryptography, multi-authority attribute-based encryption) for best security. The main goal of this project is to investigate how cryptographic access control is and can be used in blockchain-based applications to enforce access control policies in complex cross-organizational scenarios.

        title: Cryptographic Revocation
        thesisID: GiorgiaGabardi_BA
        description: >
          There is a strong interest in privacy-enhancing technologies to satisfy the complex requirements of digital identity, in particular minimizing the personal data shared at each presentation and preventing others from correlating the activity of digital identity credential holders between presentations. Important use cases are the Mobile Driver's License (ISO 18013-5) and the European Digital Identity Wallet.<br /> Cryptographic accumulators, e.g., [BdM93, N05, LLX07, BBF18, VB20] are efficient protocols to prove set (non-)membership that have been proposed as privacy-enhancing credential revocation mechanisms for digital credentials, e.g., [CL02].<br /> During the internship, you will have an opportunity to consider theoretical and practical aspects of these technologies, to be agreed upon based on your interest and prior knowledge. We are particularly interested in a performance comparison of algorithms of interest, possibly using existing libraries (e.g., accumulator-rs).

        title: Key Recovery
        thesisID: SaraMontanari_MA
        description: >
          Safeguarding private keys presents many issues, especially for the general public. Private keys can be easily lost or forgotten, leading to the inaccessibility of the assets which they control. On the other hand, delegating full control of the keys to a third party for safekeeping is risky and may not be viable. We would like to implement and test a recently proposed cryptographic key recovery scheme [BLM22] based on a distributed secret sharing that allows some parties to be offline during the key-generation process.
