          title: Cryptographic Revocation
          description: >
            There is a strong interest in privacy-enhancing technologies to satisfy the complex requirements of digital identity, in particular minimizing the personal data shared at each presentation, and preventing others from correlating the activity of digital identity credential holders between presentations. Important use cases are the Mobile Drivers’ License (ISO 18013-5) and the European Digital Identity Wallet.
            Cryptographic accumulators, e.g., [BdM93, N05, LLX07, BBF18, VB20] are efficient protocols to prove set (non-)membership that have been proposed as privacy-enhancing credential revocation mechanisms for digital credentials, e.g., [CL02].
            During the internship, you will have an opportunity to consider theoretical and practical aspects of these technologies, to be agreed based on your interest and prior knowledge. We are particularly interested in a performance comparison of algorithms of interest, possibly using existing libraries (e.g., accumulator-rs).

            - RSA
            - Elliptic Curve Cryptography
            - Zero-Knowledge Proofs
            - Programming in Python or Rust

          title: Trusted Execution Environments for Advanced Data Protection
          thesisID: IonAndyDitu_M
          description: >
            Cryptographic Access Control (CAC) is often employed to protect the confidentiality of Cloud-hosted sensitive data from curious service providers while enforcing access control policies. Unfortunately, CAC usually incurs significant computational overhead that limits its applicability in real-world scenarios [1]. The main goal of this project is to investigate how Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX [2] can synergize with CAC to relieve these computational overheads and efficiently guarantee advanced data protection.
          level: BSc/MSc
          supervisor:
            - StefanoBerlato
            - RobertoCarbone
          prerequisites:
            - Basic knowledge of IT security
            - Basic knowledge of cryptography from cryptography-related courses
            - Basic knowledge of object-oriented programming languages (i.e., Kotlin)
          objectives:
            - Familiarization and study of the state of the art in the use of TEEs for advanced data protection.
            - Evaluation of available techniques and design of a solution joining CAC with TEEs to reduce the cryptographic computational overhead.
            - Implementation of the proposed approach in a tool [3] developed and actively maintained by the Security&Trust unit in FBK [4].
          topics:
            - Access Control
            - Cryptography
            - TEE
