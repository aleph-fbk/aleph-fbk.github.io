METAfora wants to implement new and innovative models of **digital identity management** and use, placing itself in the strategic confluence between the evolutions of European regulations on the subject, thus a regulated and top-down context, and the dynamics of growth and evolution arising from below, understood as the whole world that is now described as metaverse.

METAfora designs and develops a range of cybersecurity technologies, particularly for **digital identity** and cryptographic key management. The use of artificial intelligence makes it possible to manage processes related to digital identity under more secure conditions. In particular, the use of AI increases the productivity of onboarding processes (because it reduces the need for human operator intervention). The architecture developed in the project is highly secure due to the adoption of design, development, verification and execution behavior analysis methodologies that integrate AI elements within them.
