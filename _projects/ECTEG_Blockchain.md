This project aims to develop a course on blockchain technology to train and educate law enforcement agents (LEA) and Judicial authorities fighting criminal activities that exploit blockchain-related resources, such as cryptocurrencies. The course will consist of 2 modules: basic (online) and advanced (on-site).

Merging experiences and prior developments is key to ensure a compound and multifaceted training product, that covers the myriad of challenges blockchain technology presents for criminal investigations. As usual, practical and theoretical skills and knowledge will be put to work, while the cooperation with Eurojust-ECJN is key to map the procedures in the EU to include different guidelines/legislation for the seizing of cryptoassets.

The main beneficiaries of this project are:
* All LEA officers who need basic training on blockchain technology and may attend the first module to gain this baseline expertise;
* LEA officers who want to specialise in blockchain investigations and deepen their knowledge with the second, more specialised module;
* All European Union Members States’ Judicial authorities dealing with criminal phenomena involving cryptocurrencies.
