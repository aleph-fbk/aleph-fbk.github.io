The project aims to conceive and develop a platform (called **Familiar**) that enables the creation of a coordination system for *Long Term Care (LTC) services* using innovative digital technologies, with a specific focus on the field of dementia. The ultimate goal is to **enhance the quality of life for patients and increase support for their families**.

In this context, FBK provides technical-scientific support for eliciting *security requirements* as well as *designing the architecture* of the platform, defining technologies and tools for user authentication and to ensure certification, authenticity, confidentiality and integrity of data.
