In the scope of the Italian Partnership - Partenariato Esteso “**Security and Rights in CyberSpace**” (**SeRiCS**), FBK is participating in  the “Spoke 4: Operating Systems and Virtualization Security” project “Securing Containers (SecCo)”, and in the “Spoke 5: Cryptography and Distributed Systems Security” project “Secure and TRaceable Identities in Distributed Environments (STRIDE)”.

**SecCo** aims at supporting the secure development and deployment of containerized applications on distributed and heterogeneous architectures.

The goals of **STRIDE** include supporting the secure, protected, and accountable identification of entities and actions through digital identity and access control.
