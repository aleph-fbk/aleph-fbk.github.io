We have just launched the [ALEPH Website](/), a showcase of our research unit! We will report on our projects, publications and activities in this section, besides other news related to the research unit, to the center, and more. Big thanks to [Marco Pernpruner](https://st.fbk.eu/people/marco-pernpruner), developer of the Security and Trust website, from which we forked the current structure.

Stay tuned for more!
