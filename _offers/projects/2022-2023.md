          title: Trusted Execution Environments for Advanced Data Protection
          thesisID: IonAndyDitu_M
          description: >
            Cryptographic Access Control (CAC) is often employed to protect the confidentiality of Cloud-hosted sensitive data from curious service providers while enforcing access control policies. Unfortunately, CAC usually incurs significant computational overhead that limits its applicability in real-world scenarios [1]. The main goal of this project is to investigate how Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX [2] can synergize with CAC to relieve these computational overheads and efficiently guarantee advanced data protection.
          level: BSc/MSc
          supervisor:
            - StefanoBerlato
            - RobertoCarbone
          prerequisites:
            - Basic knowledge of IT security
            - Basic knowledge of cryptography from cryptography-related courses
            - Basic knowledge of object-oriented programming languages (i.e., Kotlin)
          objectives:
            - Familiarization and study of the state of the art in the use of TEEs for advanced data protection.
            - Evaluation of available techniques and design of a solution joining CAC with TEEs to reduce the cryptographic computational overhead.
            - Implementation of the proposed approach in a tool [3] developed and actively maintained by the Security&Trust unit in FBK [4].
          topics:
            - Access Control
            - Cryptography
            - TEE
          timeFrame: From February 2023
