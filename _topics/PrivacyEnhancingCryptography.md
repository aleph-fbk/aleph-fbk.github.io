[Privacy-Enhancing Cryptography](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/pec) is a broad class of schemes enabling parties to interact meaningfully while revealing the least possible information to one another, or to third parties.

The current focus in aleph is on applications to digital identity, maximizing privacy by design in the interactions between issuers, holders, and verifiers of credentials. Examples include signatures for the selective disclosure of attributes, accumulators for revocation, and zero-knowledge proofs for unlinkable presentation.
