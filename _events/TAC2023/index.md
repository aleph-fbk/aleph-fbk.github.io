# Scope & Topics

Topics in Applied Cryptography 2023 (TAC2023) is a workshop dedicated to cryptography with a specific application, scenario and/or technology in mind, including performance evaluation, libraries and implementation issues, hardware and IoT, attacks and vulnerabilities, and requirements for unusual application scenarios; purely theoretical results are out of scope. Topics of interest include privacy enhancing cryptography, homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, quantum key distribution, and quantum-safe cryptography.
