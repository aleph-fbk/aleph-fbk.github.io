# Scope & Topics

Topics in Applied Cryptography 2025 (TAC2025) is a workshop dedicated to cryptography with a specific application, scenario and/or technology in mind, including performance evaluation, libraries and implementation issues, hardware and IoT, attacks and vulnerabilities, and requirements for unusual application scenarios; purely theoretical results are out of scope. Topics of interest include privacy enhancing cryptography, homomorphic encryption, secure multi-party computation, quantum key distribution, and quantum-safe cryptography.

# Registration

To participate it is necessary to [register on the conference page](https://www.decifris.it/cifris25/registration). The registration is **free of charge**.

      <p class="title">Transparent Verification in E-Voting</p>
      <p class="speakers">Abstract: the main challenge in secure e-voting is to allow voters to verify their cast vote while preserving strong privacy notions, especially preventing vote-buying and coercion. We will introduce the electronic voting schemes Selene and Hyperion which offer a very transparent form of verifiability allowing voters to find and check their plaintext vote directly in the tally result while preserving coercion-mitigation. We will introduce new, more general security definitions to capture the context of these schemes and prove their security. Finally, we will see how we can achieve both everlasting privacy and everlasting coercion-mitigation for Hyperion, as well as speculating on the post-quantum migration of the scheme.</p>

# Call for Submissions

The call for submissions is now closed.
<!-- If you have a proposal for a talk or demo, please send an extended abstract of maximum 2 pages to `tac@fbk.eu`.
Submissions will be subject to a rolling review, i.e., abstracts will be evaluated as soon as the organizing committee will receive them.
Proposals that will be deemed suitable and interesting (by criteria of novelty, significance, and potential to spark engaging discussion that benefits the community) will be accepted within a short time-frame (a few working days).
The call will be closed once the time capacity of the workshop will be reached, or by the 22nd of August at the latest.
Note that the rolling review process favours earlier submissions. -->
