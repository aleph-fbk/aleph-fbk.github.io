Riccardo Longo is a Researcher in the Applied Cryptography (ALEPH) unit of the Cybersecurity Center of Fondazione Bruno Kessler.His Alma Mater is the University of Trento, where he received the BSc degree in Mathematics in September 2012 with a thesis on Game Theory, the MSc in October 2014 with a thesis on Attribute-Based Encryption, and the PhD in Mathematics in March 2018 with a thesis on Provable Security of Cryptographic Protocols.

He briefly worked as a Cybersecurity consultant for GDPR compliance before returning in June 2019 to UniTN as a postdoctoral researcher, working on Blockchains, Threshold Signatures, E-Voting and other cryptographic protocols, first with Prof. Massimiliano Sala (who also supervised his MSc and PhD theses) and then with Prof. Silvio Ranise. In June 2023, he moved to the newborn Applied Cryptography (ALEPH) research unit of Fondazione Bruno Kessler. He has been a Teaching Assistant for the Mathematics master degree course "Algebraic Cryptography" at the University of Trento, and since 2020 he is TA for the Mathematics and Computer Science master degree courses "Applied Cryptography" and "Advanced Programming of Cryptographic Methods".
Since 2018 he teaches the Cryptography course in the "Alta Formazione" (post-diploma) degree offered by Istituto Tecnico Tecnologico Marconi of Rovereto.

His research focuses on cryptographic protocols and their provable security via security games and reductions to hardness assumptions on mathematical problems.
