Stefano Berlato is a student of the PhD Program in Security, Risk and Vulnerability, jointly offered by the University of Genoa and Fondazione Bruno Kessler. He received the BSc degree in Computer Science from the University of Trento in 2017, and the MSc degree in Computer Science "ICT Innovation - Security & Privacy" from the University of Trento in 2019.

He joined the Security & Trust research unit in October 2018 as a Research Assistant, working on the implementation of cryptographic access control schemes. In November 2020, he started his PhD under the supervision of Prof. Silvio Ranise and Dr. Roberto Carbone. In June 2023, he moved to the newborn Applied Cryptography (ALEPH) research unit of Fondazione Bruno Kessler. From 2020, he has been a Teaching Assistant for the Computer Science bachelor degree course "Programmazione 1" at the University of Trento.

His research focuses on applied cryptography and the design of architectural models and orchestration optimization methodologies for cryptographic access control schemes in decentralized scenarios.
