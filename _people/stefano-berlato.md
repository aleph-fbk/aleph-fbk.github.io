Stefano Berlato is a Researcher at the Applied Cryptography (ALEPH) research unit of the Center for Cybersecurity in Fondazione Bruno Kessler. He received the BSc degree in Computer Science from the University of Trento in 2017, the MSc degree in Computer Science "ICT Innovation - Security & Privacy" from the University of Trento in 2019, and the PhD in Security, Risk and Vulnerability from the University of Genoa in 2024.

He joined the Security & Trust research unit in October 2018 as a Research Assistant, working on the implementation of cryptographic access control schemes. In November 2020, he started his PhD under the supervision of Prof. Silvio Ranise and Dr. Roberto Carbone. In June 2023, he moved to the newborn ALEPH research unit of Fondazione Bruno Kessler. He has been a Teaching Assistant for the Computer Science bachelor degree course "Programmazione 1" at the University of Trento from 2020 to 2024 and is a Teaching Assistant for the master courses "Advanced Programming of Cryptographic Methods" and "Cryptographic Protocols for Secure Networks and Applications" since 2024.

His research focuses on applied cryptography and the design of architectural models and orchestration optimization methodologies for cryptographic access control schemes in decentralized scenarios.
