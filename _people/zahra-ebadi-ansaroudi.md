I am Zahra Ebadi Ansaroudi, a dedicated researcher in Computer Science, with a specialization in Cryptography. My primary focus is on investigating cryptographic protocols to address security and privacy concerns in emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain. Currently, I am deeply intrigued by identity management and digital identity solutions, with the goal of empowering individuals to have greater control over their personal information.

I earned my PhD from the University of Salerno, Italy, where my doctoral thesis, titled "A Study of Some Cryptographic Protocols for the Future Internet," explored cutting-edge cryptography and its applications in IoT security and blockchain-based consensus protocols. As a researcher at the Applied Cryptography Unit of Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) in Italy, I actively contribute to advancing digital identity solutions.

My passion lies in driving innovation, unravelling the complexities of digital identities, and making meaningful contributions to the field of cryptography, ultimately shaping a secure future Internet.
